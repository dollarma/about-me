                    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <p>Growing up ,I had always been fascinated by the natural world and had a strong desire to help  others. This led me to pursue a career in medicine,and i enrolled as a biology student in High school.
                    </p>

            <div class="journey-card">
                <h2>A change in Direction</h2>
                <p>However,as I progressed through my studies, I faced a significant setback. My grades,although good,were not good enough to secure a spot in a university to study medicine</p>


            </div>
           
                       <div class="journey-card" >
                        <h2>Discovering Web Development</h2>
                        <p></p>
                       </div>
                       <p>It was during this time that I began to explore other fields that aligned with my strengths and interests. I had always been strong in math and physics,and I was fascinated by the rapid evolution of technology. This led me to discover the world of Computer science and web development
                       I was immediately drawn to the creative and problem-solving aspect of web development. I began  to teach myself the basics of coding, and I was hooked. I realized that this was a field that was not only in high demand but also offered endless opportunities for growth and innovation.</p>
